# Predictive-analytics-with-Facebook-Interaction
It's a collaborated Class Project for MA575 Linear Models.
	This project aims at finding a reasonable and accurate prediction between 7 factors(page total likes, type, category, post month, post weekday, post hour, paid) and the sum number of “likes”, “comments” and “shares” figures by using Rstudio. The prediction is based on the platform of linear regression model. Transformation is applied to fit the assumptions of linear regression. To find the best fit model, several variable selections(AIC, AICc, BIC, Backward AIC/BIC, Forward AIC/BIC, Ridge) and cross validations were carried out. Ultimately, Only 5 variables ( type, category, post weekday, post hour, paid) were selected into our final model to make an appropriate prediction.
